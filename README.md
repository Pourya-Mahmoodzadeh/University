This repository contains (preferably) most of what I have been doing as an **undergraduate student** majoring in **camputer engineering** in **Amir Kabir University of Technology**.

##Explanations regarding what to expect and how to use:
To see a considerable part of my self-practices, assigned homework alongside with my provided answers, etc, you can simply see the contents of the directory with the same name of the course.
I have tried to have the contents mostly in english, programming languages, hardware description languages (I think these can also be counted as programming languages, am I right?), and any other form that most people worldwide will be able to understand more easily, but unavoidable, some contents are/may be in Persian, which is the language in which we are taught Persian.
